## Code

```lua
local Osiris AI = require(script.Parent.Orionai)

-- Main module logic
local function main()
	math.randomseed(137)  -- For reproducibility
	
	local trainingData = {
		-- Enemy close, few resources, little support: Retreat
		{inputs = {0.9, 0.2, 0.1}, output = {0, 0, 0, 1}},
		-- Enemy far, abundant resources, moderate support: Explore
		{inputs = {0.1, 0.8, 0.5}, output = {1, 0, 0, 0}},
		-- Additional scenarios...
	}

    -- Initialize a quantum-inspired neural network
	local aiDrone = Osiris.QuantumNetwork.new(3, 12, 4)
	aiDrone:train(trainingData, 1000)

	local gameScenario = {1, 1, 0}  -- Example scenario
	local actionIndex = aiDrone:quantumInspiredPredict(gameScenario)
	local actions = {"Explore", "Call for Support", "Engage in Combat", "Retreat"}
	local chosenAction = actions[actionIndex]

## Documentation

### Concept Overview

Osiris AI next-generation hybrid AI agent that merges the reasoning capabilities of classical AI with the problem-solving power of quantum-inspired algorithms. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on linear logic, Polaris taps into quantum superposition and entanglement principles to analyze multiple outcomes simultaneously. This hybrid system allows Polaris to solve complex, multi-variable problems with precision, speed, and insight that far surpasses classical AI alone.


### What Makes Osiris AI Unique?

- Quantum-Classical Synergy
- Predictive Pattern Recognition
- Data Ingestion
- Quantum-Classical Computation
  

### Use Cases of Osiris AI:


1. Market Sentiment Analysis & Trading AI
How It Works: Polaris tracks online forums, social media engagement, and financial market data to spot early signs of FOMO, hype cycles, and sell-offs.
Quantum Advantage: While classical AI agents process sentiment data sequentially, Polaris processes multiple "possibilities" simultaneously. It can predict and flag potential price swings before they occur.
Example: A user asks, "Is this token likely to pump?" Polaris detects the rise in social sentiment, correlates it with historical pump patterns, and offers a prediction with a confidence score.

2. Supply Chain & Logistics Optimization
How It Works: Polaris helps companies optimize their supply chain by evaluating multiple delivery routes, shipment schedules, and inventory constraints at once.
Quantum Advantage: Solving large-scale, multi-objective optimization problems (like "what is the fastest and cheapest delivery route?") is computationally difficult for traditional AI. Quantum-inspired optimization allows Polaris to find the best path in seconds.
Example: A logistics manager asks, "What's the optimal shipping route for these orders?" Orion instantly visualizes multiple possibilities, selects the optimal path, and adjusts for delays and cost.

3. Scientific Research & Simulations
How It Works: Polaris assists researchers in fields like drug discovery, molecular design, and material science by simulating particle interactions and chemical reactions.
Quantum Advantage: Quantum-inspired models can simulate molecular structures at atomic precision, something that is infeasible with traditional AI.
Example: A researcher asks, "What molecular structure is most stable for this new drug compound?" Polaris runs quantum chemistry simulations and offers multiple stable configurations, saving years of trial-and-error experimentation.

4. Cybersecurity & Threat Detection
How It Works: Polaris detects emerging cyber threats by tracking unusual traffic patterns and behavioral anomalies.
Quantum Advantage: Quantum-inspired cryptography allows Polaris to recognize anomalies in encrypted communications, providing an early warning of cyberattacks.
Example: A cybersecurity analyst asks, "Is there any unusual traffic on the network?" Polaris identifies a suspicious connection pattern and suggests proactive actions to prevent potential breaches.

## Conclusion

Osiris's concept is both feasible and transformative. Quantum-inspired algorithms are already being used by companies like D-Wave, Google Quantum AI, and Azure Quantum. By combining this logic with blockchain and AI-driven research, Polaris becomes a game-changing agent for researchers, scientists, and innovators worldwide.
