## Code

```lua
local Orion AI = require(script.Parent.Orionai)

-- Main module logic
local function main()
	math.randomseed(137)  -- For reproducibility
	
	local trainingData = {
		-- Enemy close, few resources, little support: Retreat
		{inputs = {0.9, 0.2, 0.1}, output = {0, 0, 0, 1}},
		-- Enemy far, abundant resources, moderate support: Explore
		{inputs = {0.1, 0.8, 0.5}, output = {1, 0, 0, 0}},
		-- Additional scenarios...
	}

    -- Initialize a quantum-inspired neural network
	local aiDrone = OrionAI.QuantumNetwork.new(3, 12, 4)
	aiDrone:train(trainingData, 1000)

	local gameScenario = {1, 1, 0}  -- Example scenario
	local actionIndex = aiDrone:quantumInspiredPredict(gameScenario)
	local actions = {"Explore", "Call for Support", "Engage in Combat", "Retreat"}
	local chosenAction = actions[actionIndex]

	print("AI Decision:", chosenAction)
end

main()

### How Orion AI is Different

Orion AI (Hybrid AI + Blockchain) Traditional Research Agents
Ownership Research data tokenized on-chain No ownership; publishers own data
Computation Type Hybrid (Classical + Quantum-Inspired) Classical AI (Linear)
Monetization Monetize research with tokenized insights No user compensation
Speed Processes multiple possibilities simultaneously Sequential logic
User Interaction Chat-based assistant and marketplace Limited to manual reports
Governance DAO-driven research priorities Centralized funding decisions

### Why It Matters

- Speed: Processes multiple outcomes simultaneously, unlike step-by-step classical AI.
- Ownership: Tokenizes insights so users can claim, license, and monetize their data.
- Collaboration: Uses a DAO model for collaborative research with shared royalties.
- Data Integrity: Every discovery is stored on-chain, creating a tamper-proof research log.
- Quantum-Inspired Efficiency: Uses superposition and multi-variable logic to analyze complex problems with speed and precision.
